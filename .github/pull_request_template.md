## Title

Please **pick a concise, informative and complete title** for your PR.

## Motivation

Please explain the motivation behind this PR in the description.

## Issue #, if available

If you're adding a new feature, then consider opening an issue and discussing it with the maintainers (GitHub Username ``MacHu-GWU``) before you actually do the hard work.

## Description of changes:

Please explain the changes you have made here.

By submitting this pull request, I confirm that you can use, modify, copy, and redistribute this contribution, under the terms of your choice.

## Tests

If you're fixing a bug, consider [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development):

1. Create a unit test that demonstrates the bug. The test should **fail**.
2. Implement your bug fix.
3. The test you created should now **pass**.

If you're implementing a new feature, include unit tests for it.

Make sure all existing unit tests pass.

## Work in progress

If you're still working on your PR, include "WIP" in the title.
We'll skip reviewing it for the time being.
Once you're ready to review, remove the "WIP" from the title, and ping one of the maintainers (e.g. mpenkov).

## Checklist

Before you create the PR, please make sure you have:

- [ ] Picked a concise, informative and complete title
- [ ] Clearly explained the motivation behind the PR
- [ ] Linked to any existing issues that your PR will be solving
- [ ] Included tests for any new functionality
- [ ] Checked that all unit tests pass

## Workflow

Please avoid rebasing and force-pushing to the branch of the PR once a review is in progress.
Rebasing can make your commits look a bit cleaner, but it also makes life more difficult from the reviewer, because they are no longer able to distinguish between code that has already been reviewed, and unreviewed code.
